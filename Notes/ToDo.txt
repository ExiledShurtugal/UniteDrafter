Priorities:
- Change decoder from Python to C#  ->  DONE
- Automate scraping ( cloudflare blocking, GUARANTEE IT WORKS MANUALLY for now )
- Create structures from JSON components -> prepare DB
- Extract from JSONs to DB
- Script DB functions and unit tests
- Build interface


Non priority:
- Cloudflare blocking scraping; manually scraping for mvp, learn puppeteer/playright later
- Automate scraping and updating DB on a timer

Added roadmap items:
- Turn `Program.cs` into a tiny CLI
- Introduce folder boundaries:
  - `src/` for app code,
  - `tests/` for test project,
  - `data/` for snapshots/examples.
- Add a short architecture/status section to README:
  - “Current implemented: decryptor POC”
  - “Planned: scraper, DB pipeline, draft model, UI”.
