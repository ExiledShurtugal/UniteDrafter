# Decrypter tests

This folder contains automated tests for the decrypter.

## Run from repo root

```
dotnet clean
dotnet test Tests/Decrypter/DecrypterTests.csproj --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

Expected outcomes:

1. xUnit test results in the console (`Passed` / `Failed`).
2. Decrypted fixture artifacts written to:
   - `Tests/Decrypter/TestResults/decrypted_rankings.json`
   - `Tests/Decrypter/TestResults/decrypted_player_DFM_Serata.json`

Those files are generated by fixture-based tests and let you manually inspect decrypted output (rankings + player).

## Troubleshooting

- If fixture test says file not found, run command from repository root (`UniteDrafter/`).
- If one test fails in `SplitBlobGuess`, update tests first (`git pull`) because that test was tightened to use a realistic payload length.
