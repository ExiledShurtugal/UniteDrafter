# UniteDrafting
Working on a tool to statistically predict which team has advantage during a Pokémon Unite draft, helping players make data-driven Pokémon choices


# Tech stack
- Front-end = Blazor
Front-end chose to use Blazor in order to progress quickly as I don't currently have any project to show on my resume and I can continue learning React later on the course I started a while back

- Database = SQLite
Under the impression that SQL versions are mostly easily interchangeable and SQLite works locally and fast -> MVP mindset

- Back-end = C#
Blazor makes C# almost an auto include unless there's a strong reason for another language. Initial decoding script is in python but will change later to C#
